# Exploring-the-Intersection-of-Machine-Learning-and-Explainable-Artificial-Intelligence-An-Analysis-
The use of machine learning models has greatly
enhanced the capability to recognize patterns and draw
conclusions. However, due to their black-box nature, it can be
difficult to comprehend the factors that affect their decisions.
XAI methods offer transparency into these models and aid
in enhancing comprehension, examination, and trust in their
outcomes. In this paper, we present a study on the use of machine
learning (ML) models for intrusion detection in Windows 10
Operating systems using the ToN-IoT dataset. We investigate the
performance of different ML models including tree-based models
such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic
Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in detecting
these attacks. Furthermore, we use Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques to understand how the attacks
influence the processes in the Windows 10 systems and how
they can be identified and prevented. Our study highlights the
importance of using XAI techniques to make ML models more
interpretable and trustworthy in high-stakes applications such
as intrusion detection. We believe that this work can contribute
to the development of more robust and secure operating systems.
This research aims to look into an advanced detection algorithm based on an explainable AI (XAI) model. Using ML and XAI, we seek to identify the features and procedures that are genuinely crucial for identifying anomalies.
